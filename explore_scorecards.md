Scorecards reflect the strategic goals of an organization. Using scorecards, you can identify how well objectives are being met by comparing targets to actual results. Visual status indicators such as traffic lights, trend icons, and colors are used to help you to quickly evaluate performance.

In {{site.data.keyword.planninganalytics_short}}, you can add existing scorecards to your books, and analyze data by selecting different time periods, metrics, and dimensions. You can also create visualizations from scorecards, such as impact diagrams and strategy maps.

You can explore scorecards in {{site.data.keyword.planninganalytics_short}} with the GO_Scorecards sample.
