Improved availability of manual database backups in Planning Analytics Workspace on Planning Analytics as a Service
:   A new location for manual database backups in Planning Analytics Workspace on Planning Analytics as a Service makes it easier to access and use backups.

:   Prior to Planning Analytics Workspace 2.0.93, manual database backups were stored in the .backupsets directory of File Manager on the Modeling Workbench, which is within the Planning Analytics Workspace database. This location made it impossible to access manual backups when the database was unavailable.

:   Conversely, automated database backups were stored to a location external to the database, which remains accessible even when the associated Planning Analytics Workspace database is unavailable.

:   As of Planning Analytics Workspace 2.0.93, both manual and automated database backups in Planning Analytics Workspace on Planning Analytics as a Service are stored in a location external to the database. All manual backups created in Planning Analytics Workspace 2.0.93 or later and all automated backups appear on the database Backups tab, regardless of the current state of the database.

:   This change means that manual backups created prior to Planning Analytics Workspace 2.0.93 and stored in File Manager no longer appear on the Backups tab. You can, however, continue to access any such backups directly through File Manager.
