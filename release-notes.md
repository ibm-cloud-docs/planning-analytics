## How should I set up my release notes page?
{: #relnotes-page-setup}
{: release-note}

* Use "Release notes for xxx" as your page title, where xxx is the short name with no trademarks.
* Name the file `release-notes.md` for URL readability.
* If you require multiple release notes files, group under a "Release Notes" topicgroup and use a unique name for each file.
* Add each release as an H2 or H3, depending on how frequently your service releases updates. If you release monthly or less, use an H2 for each entry. If you release several times a month, use an H2 with the month to group each H3 entry in that month.
* The first entry in your release notes file should introduce your service and reflect the release date of the service.
* Use a definition list entry for each update, change, or new item in that release.
* Set the `release-note` content type attribute definition at the top of your file.
* Set the `release-note` content type attribute on a new line following each H2 release entry.
* Do not repeat task steps. Summarize and link to task topic.
* Do not include security bulletins or maintenance notifications in this file. There is a separate process for these types of notifications.

## What should I include in my release note entries?
{: #release-notes-content-include}
{: release-note}

Use a definition list to highlight each item covered in the release. Each entry should summarize the release details. You want to make sure you are not re-documenting information that is already available in documentation because then you'd have to maintain it in two places. If a more detailed explanation for the change exists out in a documentation page, then link out to the doc. For guidance on coding definition lists, [Definition lists](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/writing?topic=writing-lists#definition-lists).

Because this content is single-sourced and pulled into the Status UI, you can only include the following markup in your definition list entries: paragraph, ordered list item, unordered list item, code phrase, links, keyrefs, bold, and italics. Any other markup is not supported.

For guidance on what to include on this page, review [Release notes guidance](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/writing?topic=writing-releasenotes). -->
